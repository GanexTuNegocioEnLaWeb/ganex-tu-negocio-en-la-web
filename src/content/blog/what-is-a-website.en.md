> In this guide, I’ll explain **what a website is**, what it’s used for, the different types that exist, and how it can help you **grow your business online** in a strategic way.

## What is a website?

Imagine a _web page_ like a _page from a traditional newspaper_. We’re not talking about the entire newspaper, but **a single page**: an individual space that contains organized information.

That page has elements very similar to a printed newspaper:

- Headings
- Main and secondary titles
- Paragraphs
- Images
- Lists
- Links

The difference is that a **web page lives on the Internet** and can be accessed from anywhere in the world using a browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

Each web page is a **unique digital document**, designed to inform, persuade, or trigger a specific action (contact, purchase, sign up, etc.).

## How does a browser understand a web page?

Browsers know what each element is thanks to **HyperText Markup Language**, better known as [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).

HTML uses **tags** to indicate what type of content each part of the text represents.

### Basic HTML example

```html
<h1>I am a main heading</h1>
<h2>I am a secondary heading</h2>
<p>I am a paragraph of text</p>
```

These tags tell the browser and Google **what is important and what is not** within a web page.

It is also possible to write text without tags:

```html
I am text without a tag
```

### What is the problem with not using tags?

The biggest issue is **SEO**.

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** helps search engines like Google understand and rank your content. Without a clear HTML structure:

- Google doesn’t understand your content
- Your page won’t rank properly
- You lose visibility and potential customers

> 💡 **Important tip:** A well-structured HTML page has a much higher chance of appearing in the top search results.

## Can you create a website easily?

> **Did you know you can create a web page with a simple text file?**

You just need to:

1. Create a `.txt` file (for example, using Notepad)
2. Write any text (e.g. _Hello world_)
3. Save it as `any_name.html`

🎉 Congratulations! You’ve just created your **first web page**.

Of course, a professional website requires much more: design, SEO, speed optimization, user experience, and digital strategy.

## What does a website contain?

A modern website may include:

1. SEO-optimized text
2. Images
3. Videos
4. Internal and external links
5. Contact forms
6. Interactive buttons (CTA)
7. Integrations with WhatsApp or social media

All of this has one main goal: **turn visitors into customers**.

## Web page vs website: the key difference

Many people confuse these two concepts:

| Term         | Definition                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Web page** | A single HTML document on the Internet   |
| **Website**  | A collection of interconnected web pages |

For example:

- The **home page**
- The **blog page**
- The **contact page**

These are _individual web pages_, but together they form a **complete website**.

## What is a website used for?

A well-designed website can help you:

- Increase visibility for a business or personal brand
