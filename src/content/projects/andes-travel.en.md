Likely search intents based on content:

- Bolivia travel packages search  
- Local travel operator services

- Semantic content depth per tour and destination

Outcome: Stronger **search engine relevance signals**, improved rank potential.

### 3. **Multilingual SEO Approach**

Although two languages are present (Español / English), implementation must ensure:

- Proper hreflang tagging
